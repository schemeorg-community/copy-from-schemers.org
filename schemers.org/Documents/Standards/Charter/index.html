<h3>A Charter for Change (R6RS)</h3>

<p>
A draft version of R6RS is now available from
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/"><code>www.r6rs.org</code></a>.
The charter provides for a six-month public comment period.
The comment period is now open and will continue until March 15, 2007.
</p>

<p>
The R6RS editors asked for the following announcements to be included
here:
</p>

<hr>

<ol>

<li>
Shortly after we began our work, we created a mailing list for our
discussions and agreed that the mailing list archive should be made
public at some point after the R6RS was published.  During our
September 12, 2006 meeting, we voted to make the archive public
immediately.  It has taken us a while to get around to it, but the
archive is now available at 
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/r6rs-editors/"><code>http://www.r6rs.org/r6rs-editors/</code></a>.
</li>

<li>
During our October 19, 2006 meeting, we committed to providing a
formal response by December 15, 2006 to all formal comments submitted
by November 15, 2006.  The timing of our formal responses to formal
comments submitted after that date will be decided at a later time.
For more information on the formal review process, see
<a href="http://www.r6rs.org/process.html"><code>http://www.r6rs.org/process.html</code></a>.
</li>

<li>
Also during our October 19th meeting, we committed to producing a new
draft of the R6RS by January 15, 2007, which will take into account
comments and suggestions made by November 15, 2006.  LaTeX source code
will also be provided for the drafts.
</li>

</ol>

<p>
We appreciate the response to date from members of the Scheme community.
