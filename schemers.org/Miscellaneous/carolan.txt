Hello

I have used DrScheme for a few days now and have enjoyed it very much.

I am very impressed with the quality and usability of the software and I am
grateful that you have made it available on the 'Net.

I worte this rhyme today and I thought you might like it as a token of my
appreciation.

"Reflecting in those things that might have been:
How Isaac Newton further far has seen
confronting that vast Ocean of Unknown
the shoulders that he stands on are his own.
First on his left, then his remaining hand
the half-dimensioned fractal of the strand.
Dreams (that he is dreaming in a dream)
the lithe recursive calculus of Scheme."

Thank you, and enjoy!
