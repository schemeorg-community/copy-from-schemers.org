  original posting

[Though this posting is about Common Lisp jobs, the company welcomes
 and may consider at an advantage Schemers who are willing to make the
 transition to Common Lisp and thus harness skills from both paradigms.]

Content Integrity is developing Webcentric Change Management products
for Business-to-Business ("B2B") web sites.  This is an exciting
newly-funded startup opportunity, equity is available, and candidates
will be responsible for developing state of the art web applications.
 
The positions below are described from back-end to front-end.  Back
end developers should be bit tweakers who know how to make scalable
high performance data stores on object and/or relational
databases. Front end developers should be top notch web application
developers who know every DHTML and Java applet browser interface
trick in the book.  In the middle are people familiar with application
servers and all that goes with it (load balancing, parallelism, and
every socket/security/authentication protocol under the sun).
 
Most of the product is coded in Common Lisp and Java, but a variety of
other language and technology skills are required depending on the
position.  There are some substantial data modeling and analysis tasks
centered on XML and HTML.  The models will be built using our unique
versioned modeling engine.
 
The environment is friendly, relatively ego-free, and occasional
telecommuting is okay. "Can-do" people will be rewarded, whether
you're just out of school or you've been doing this work for 20 years.
 
The office location is TBD since we're going to get new office space
one way or the other.  Currently CII is in Braintree, but we're
considering moving to points north.  The commute is traffic-free
(opposite the heavy volume traffic flows).  It's 23 minutes from the
route 20 / route 128 intersection, and 20 minutes from Boston.  We're
right on the Braintree red line and commuter rail stop.
 
Please send resumes to jobs@content-integrity.com.  Principals only,
please.
 
 
  General Skills
 
*    Cross platform, HP/UX, Solaris, Linux, Windows NT.
*    C, C++, Common Lisp, Java.
*    Understanding revision/version/change/configuration
    management principles a big plus.
*    Web application development experience.
 
  Database (2 positions) (C/C++, Common Lisp)
 
*    Large scale object database work with ObjectStore.
*    Low level database representations to achieve optimal
    clustering and compaction (including compression) of data.
*    Nested and parallel transactions, deadlock avoidance,
    transaction restarts, hierarchical lock models.
*    Top notch object-relational mapping skills for
    deploying relational-db solutions based on complex, high
    performance object models.
*    Superlative Objectstore and Common Lisp skills to
    develop Lisp to ObjectStore interfaces.
 
  Application Server (3 positions)
      (COM, CORBA, JavaBeans, Common Lisp, Java)
 
*    Load balancing techniques.
*    Strong HTTP protocol experience, request forwarding,
    secure sockets, SHTTP.
*    Compressed and secure data transmissions,
    authentication, directory services integration (LDAP).
*    Proxy servers and other HTTP oriented cache techniques.

  XML, HTML model development (2 people) (Common Lisp, Java)
 
*    Stong knowledge of W3C XML specifications, experience
    writing and using XML processors.
*    Experience writing HTTP/HTML spiders and analyzing HTML
    page content.

    trade for developing elegant and effective web application
    interfaces.
 
*    Ability to design the total navigation scheme for an
    application that really flows for non-technical application     users.
 
  Quality Assurance Positions (3 Positions)
 
  This is not your average QA position.  You'll be called
  upon to code, script, and work with third party tools
  that ensure robust 24x7 mission and data critical web
  application operation.

    testing.
*    CROSS PLATFORM REGRESSION experience a must. Our tests
    and test agents must run on Windows NT and Unix equally
    well.
