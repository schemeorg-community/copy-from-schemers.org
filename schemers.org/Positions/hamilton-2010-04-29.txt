        Functional Programming and Automatic Differentiation

                          PhD Studentships
                       Postdoctoral Positions

We are adding exact first-class derivative calculation operators
(Automatic Differentiation or AD) to the lambda calculus, and
embodying the combination into a production-quality optimising
compiler.  Our research prototype compiler generates object code
competitive with the fastest current systems, which are based on
FORTRAN.  We are seeking PhD students and postdocs with interest and
experience in relevant areas: programming language theory, numeric
computing/numeric linear algebra, or differential geometry; and a
burning drive to help lift big iron numeric computing out of the 1960s
and into a newer higher order.  Specific sub-projects include:
compiler and numeric programming environment construction; writing,
simplifying, and generalising numeric algorithms through the use of AD
operators; and associated type/lambda calculus/PLT/real computation
issues.

The project headquarters will be in the Hamilton Institute, NUI
Maynooth, Ireland, http://www.hamilton.ie/.
