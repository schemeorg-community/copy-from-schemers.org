We are a Web and audio conferencing company in Denver, Colorado.
We're looking for talented, enthusiastic software developers who
can thrive in a fast-paced environment.

We're not a "Scheme shop", but rather a "best-tool-for-the-job
shop".  Those tools include Java, C++, Perl, Bash, Scheme, PHP,
and other languages.  The existing codebase is primarily Java.
We develop for several platforms (Windows, OSX, Linux, Solaris,
etc.), producing both end-user software and backend systems, with
emphasis on performance and reliability.

We're looking for talent more than specific skills, but we
consider the following most valuable:

 * Experience with several languages
 * Experience with large-scale and high-performance networking
 * GUI design and implementation skills
 * Low-level Windows programming skills
 * Experience with open source and free software
 * Experience with web application systems and protocols
 * Advanced database programming skills

Above all else, candidates should love learning new things and sharing
them with others.
