Lispers & Schemers wanted at Streamtech (The Netherlands)


* About us

Streamtech is a young development company in The Netherlands. We are
continuously looking for programming talent, in the form of both
fulltime employees and interns.  We spend our time building complex
web applications using mainly Common Lisp.  Notably, we offer the Bitt
suite of online profiling software.


* Who we're looking for

Programming to you is not just a job but a hobby. You've been
programming for fun for years.

You have at least some experience with Lisp or Scheme.

You like the net.

You're not blind to practical demands, but you relish doing things the
right way. When something seems to work but you're not sure how or
why, you bang your head against it until you understand.

You love exploring interesting new languages, concepts and approaches.

Having played with Haskell, Smalltalk, Prolog, Erlang, or other
interesting languages gets you bonus points. The same goes for
language/compiler implementation, kernel hacking, crypto and other
interesting activities.

Finally, you are willing to relocate to the The Hague area.


* What we offer

A challenging, fun job in a great team that does not think Java, OOP
and XML are the answer to every question.


* How to apply

Please send your resume to jobs@streamtech.nl. Include at least one
piece of code you wrote somewhat recently.  A good way to get your
resume noticed would be to solve one or more of the problems on
http://streamtech.nl/site/problem+set in your language of choice and
send us the code.


* International applicants

We love receiving international applicants. Unfortunately, however,
strict immigration laws make it impossible for us to hire fulltime
employees from outside the EU.
Note that this restriction does not apply for interns.
