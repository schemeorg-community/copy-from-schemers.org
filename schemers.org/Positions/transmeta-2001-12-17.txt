We're looking for an experienced Scheme or Lisp programmer to work on
advanced tools used in all areas of microprocessor development.
Currently, we are finishing a 30,000 line Scheme program which is a
central part of our verification effort.

You should have strong programming skills, a love of functional
programming (and being an Emacs user won't hurt you a bit), a quick
mind, some architecture or compiler experience, automation experience,
and experience developing software in other languages besides Scheme
or Lisp (because Scheme or Lisp aren't right for every job that we
will ask you to do).  If you run away from things you don't
understand, this job isn't for you.

Pluses would be knowledge of Verilog and CAD tools, assembly language
programming experience, performance analysis, and advanced
verification systems.

All resumes should be in ASCII text.

Please send resumes directly to: jason_aaron_wilson@yahoo.com
