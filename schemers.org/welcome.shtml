<p>
Welcome to schemers.org!  This is a collection of resources for the
Scheme programming language.  It was initiated by the
<a href="http://www.plt-scheme.org/">PLT</a> group at
Rice University.
It now runs on a server in the
<a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/">Brown University computer 
science department</a>.
</p>

<p>
The pages were built and are maintained by <a
href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>,
with help from other members of Rice PLT, most notably
Matthias Felleisen,
Paul Steckler and
Yan-David Erlich.
Comments, suggestions and contributions of material are always
welcome.  Please contact me at <code>sk+59@cs.brown.edu</code>.
</p>

<p>
Several people have contributed logos for this site.  The current logo
is from <a href="http://dsandler.org/">Dan Sandler</a>, a
Rice graduate who spent a summer working with PLT.  He wrote Scheme
code to rework the Rice computer science department's entire Web site,
and thus got the group thinking seriously about the Web.  Thanks, Dan!
</p>

<p>
The ``favorite'' icon &#151; the little lambda that you might see
associated with this site in some browsers, especially if you bookmark
any of its pages &#151; was generated by Mason Loring Bliss.  Thanks,
Mason!
